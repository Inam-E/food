			<li>1 teaspoon of ground cumin</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon of ground coriander</li>

			<strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></h3>
		<ol>
			<li>In a medium saucepan, bring the lentils and water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the lentils are tender and the water has been absorbed. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
			<li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for another minute.</li>
			<li>Add the cooked lentils to the skillet with the onion and garlic. Stir in the cumin, coriander, turmeric, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook for 5-10 minutes, or until the lentil mixture is heated through and the spices are fragrant.</li>
			<li>Preheat the oil for frying to 375°F (190°C).</li>
			<li>To assemble the sambusas, place a wrapper on a flat surface with one corner facing you. Place a spoonful of the lentil mixture in the center of the wrapper. Fold the corner closest to you over the filling, then fold the sides in towards the center, and roll the wrapper up tightly to form a triangular shape. Brush the edges of the wrapper with water or egg to seal.</li>
			<li>Fry the sambusas in the hot oil, turning occasionally, until golden brown on all sides, about 3-4 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.
			</li>
			<li>Serve the sambusas hot with your favorite dipping sauce or chutney.In a large bowl, whisk together the teff flour, all-purpose flour, and salt.</li>
