		<h4>FACTS</h4>
			<p>Nyama Choma is a popular grilled meat dish in many parts of East Africa, including Kenya. Its exact origin is not clear, but it is believed to have originated among the Maasai people, who are a semi-nomadic ethnic group that traditionally herds cattle in the region.
			<br>
			<br>In many Middle Eastern countries, sambusas are typically filled with spiced meat, vegetables, or cheese, while in South Asia and East Africa, they are often filled with lentils or other vegetarian ingredients. In Indian cuisine, for example, samosas are often filled with potatoes and peas, while in East Africa, they may be filled with ground beef or lamb.
			<br>Over time, Nyama Choma has become a popular dish throughout Kenya and other parts of East Africa, and it is often served in restaurants and at social events. It is typically made with beef or goat meat, although other meats such as chicken and pork can also be used.
			<br>Nyama Choma is typically served with a variety of side dishes, including ugali (a cornmeal-based dish), kachumbari (a tomato and onion salad), and sukuma wiki (collard greens). It is often enjoyed with a cold beer or other refreshing beverages.
